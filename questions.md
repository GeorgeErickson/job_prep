Given a 2D matrix of integers, sort it such that: 

- every row is sorted in ascending order from left to right 
- every column is sorted in ascending order from top to down 
- all items in the same row are unique 

You may assume the input matrix is always valid, meaning that such a sort is always possible. 

For example: 
for input matrix

1 3 5
3 2 4
the output could be any of the following: 
valid output #1:

1 3 4
2 3 5
valid output #2:

1 2 3
3 4 5
valid output #3:

1 3 4
2 3 5


Follow-up: What if all items in the same column are also required to be unique?
